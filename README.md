# 🐍 Python Gesture Controller

Control your computer's actions, like game movements and system volume, using hand gestures recognized in real-time through your webcam. This project uses OpenCV for video capture and Google's MediaPipe for powerful hand tracking and gesture recognition.

* **🚀 Launch Action**: Make a **victory/peace sign** ✌️ to open a web game in your browser.
